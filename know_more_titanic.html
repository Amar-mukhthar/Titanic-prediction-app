    <h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>
    <p>This project uses machine learning to predict the survival probability of a passenger on the Titanic based on factors such as their class, gender, age, and fare. The model was trained on the Titanic dataset and offers a probabilistic output for survival prediction.</p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Input customization for passenger details</li>
        <li>Interactive survival prediction</li>
        <li>Visualization of survival probabilities</li>
    </ul>
